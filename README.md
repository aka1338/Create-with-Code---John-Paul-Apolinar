# Create-with-Code---John-Paul-Apolinar
Programming done as part of Unity's "Create With Code" program.

# About this Repository
This repository contains all the work done for the "Create With Code" program. As I finish each prototype, I will be linking their WebGL and Windows equivalent here in the repository so that whoever stops by may play it if they choose. I will also be doing a small breakdown on each prototype as it is built. 

# Prototype 1 Box Collection w/ Car
This game involves the player operating a car with several boxes not-so-well hidden in the snow. Drive forward and backward with W and S, turn with A and D. You may also use the arrow keys to complete the same function.
